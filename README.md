# Iris-flower-predection-using-tensrorflow.


## Description :

Used tensorflow to train a model on the iris dataset and used the model to predict the class of the flower by taking 4 inputs from the user:

* sepal length           

* sepal width

* petal length

* petal width

then the class of the flower will appear as the output for the user.

## Tips before running the code:

download the code folder and make sure that the folder structure be as following to make the code run with no errors:


-final\

  --main.ipynb
  
  --project_folder\
  
  ---app.py
  
  ---templates\  
  
  ----home.html   
  
  --saved_model\
  

## How to run the code:

* run each cell in main.ipynb. "do this step if you don't have 'saved_model' folder"

* run app.py.

* in the terminal you will find this link ("http://127.0.0.1:5000") you can copy it from the terminal or from here.


or you can run the code using commands in cmd:

* run each cell in main.ipynb. "do this step if you don't have 'saved_model' folder"

* open cmd change the path to the folder containing app.py the type this command "python app.py".

* you will find the same link which is ("http://127.0.0.1:5000") you can open it then it will run just fine.
