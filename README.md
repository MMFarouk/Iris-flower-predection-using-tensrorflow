# Iris-flower-predection-using-tensrorflow\

Description:
used tensor flow to train a model on the iris dataset and used the model to predict the class of the flower by taking 4 inputs from the user:
1-sepal length
2-sepal width
3-petal length
4-petal width
then the class of the flower will appear as the output for the user.

Tips to run the code:
download the code folder and make sure that the folder structure be as following to make the code run with no errors:
final\
  main.ipynb
  project_folder\
    app.py
    templates\
      home.html
  saved_model\

How to run the code:
1-run each cell in main.ipynb. "do this step if you don't have 'saved_model' folder"
2-run app.py.
3-in the terminal you will find this link ("http://127.0.0.1:5000") you can copy it from the terminal or from here.

or you can run the code using commands in cmd:
1-run each cell in main.ipynb. "do this step if you don't have 'saved_model' folder"
2-open cmd change the path to the folder containing app.py the type this command "python app.py".
3-you will find the same link which is ("http://127.0.0.1:5000") you can open it then it will run just fine.
